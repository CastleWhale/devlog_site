          <h2>Devlog Post #1</h2>
          <h5>July 20th, 2022</h5>
          <p>Welcome to the devlog of my indie game The Eternal Dream! I began this project as an experiment and as a testbed to learn Unity. 
            At some point I realized I had quite a few ideas for where to take this project and well, here we are. I have plans to include 12 'levels' or areas to the game,
            including jumping puzzles, enemies, bosses, and some upgrades to acquire along the way. I have built out plans for a lore rich game world focused on
            visual, contextual, and log based story telling. I am currently a 1 man dev team, occasionally receiving help from friends here and there. I have an
            ambitious vision for this game, that I intend to make a reality. I hope you will join me for the ups and downs of learning to develop an indie game!
